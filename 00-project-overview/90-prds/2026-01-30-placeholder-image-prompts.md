## AI Generation Tools Recommended
- **Midjourney**: Best for whimsical 3D style (use `--style raw --v 6` for consistency)
- **DALL-E 3**: Good for child-safe, controlled output
- **Stable Diffusion**: With appropriate models (e.g., "3D Render" or "Clay Style" LoRAs)
- **Adobe Firefly**: Safe, commercial-use friendly

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Images
1. Copy each complete prompt from sections 1-3
2. Paste into your chosen AI generation tool (Midjourney, DALL-E 3, etc.)
3. Generate multiple variations (3-5 per prompt)
4. Select the best version that matches brand guidelines

### Step 2: Post-Processing
1. **Remove Background**: Use tools like remove.bg or Photoshop to ensure clean transparency
2. **Resize**: Scale to exactly 2048x2048px maintaining aspect ratio
3. **Color Correction**: Adjust to match exact brand colors if needed
4. **Optimize**: Compress using TinyPNG or similar (target: <200KB per file)

### Step 3: Quality Review
1. Check against quality checklist above
2. View on white and colored backgrounds to ensure transparency works
3. Test at different sizes (512px, 256px, 128px) to ensure clarity
4. Get stakeholder approval (designer, product manager)

### Step 4: Integration
1. Place files in appropriate directories (see Directory Structure above)
2. Update component imports in codebase
3. Test in all three languages (EN, DE, HE)
4. Verify responsive behavior on mobile/tablet/desktop
