# Character Extraction - New Method

Using the **improved** `getCharacterExtractionPrompt` with layered extraction:

```
Analyze this image and create a detailed character reference description (80-120 words) for consistent AI illustration generation.

EXTRACT THESE LAYERS:
1. PHYSICAL IDENTITY (anchors): Age/life stage, Hair (color, texture, quirks), Eyes (color, shape), Face (distinctive features)
2. EMOTIONAL BASELINE: Default expression and energy, how they carry themselves
3. PROPORTIONS: Age-appropriate body proportions, physical presence
4. SIGNATURE STYLING: Core clothing colors/style, texture cues

OUTPUT: Write a flowing paragraph capturing this character's "visual DNA" - a portable identity recognizable across any scene.
