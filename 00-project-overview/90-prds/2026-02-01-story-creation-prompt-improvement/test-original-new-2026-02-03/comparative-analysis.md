## Critical Self-Assessment

### Objectivity Check
- [x] Evaluated with same rubric for both
- [x] Scored blindly (didn't peek at other version first)
- [x] Applied same standards across languages

### Production Accuracy Check
- [x] Story JSONs match expected format
- [x] Character extraction simulates real app logic
- ⚠️ Story 10 original had page ordering error (manual fix needed)

### What We May Have Missed
- [ ] Actual image generation quality (prompts only)
- [ ] Real user feedback (simulated evaluation)
- [ ] Edge cases with complex character descriptions
