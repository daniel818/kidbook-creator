## Missing Elements to Consider

### Story Text

- [ ] Pacing consistency across 12 pages
- [ ] Language-specific quality (German compound words, Hebrew flow)

### Character/Illustration
- [ ] Reference image alignment (if provided)
- [ ] Age-appropriate visual complexity
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity in depictions

### Overall
- [ ] Input alignment (does story match user request?)
- [ ] Theme fidelity (requested vs delivered)
