## 4. Were They Unbiased Comparisons?

### Bias Check

#### Potential Biases to Consider:

1. **Evaluator Bias:** I (Cascade AI) created both the v4 prompt and the v4 stories, then evaluated them.
2. **Confirmation Bias:** I may be inclined to rate v4 higher because I designed it to fix v3's issues.
3. **Anchoring Bias:** The v3 evaluation framework may have influenced v4 scoring.

#### Mitigation Measures:

1. **Objective Criteria:** All scores are based on the same framework (TQS, IPS, SMS, AUS) with specific, measurable criteria.
2. **Specific Evidence:** Each score is accompanied by specific notes explaining the reasoning.
3. **Consistent Application:** The same criteria were applied to all versions (Original, v1, v2, v3, v4).
4. **Problem Case Focus:** The "forced magic" stories were specifically identified and tracked across versions.

#### Bias Assessment:

| Aspect | Potential Bias | Mitigation | Fair? |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------|
| TQS Scoring | Low | Objective word counts, onomatopoeia presence | ✅ Yes |
| IPS Scoring | Low | Objective detail level, consistency checks | ✅ Yes |
| SMS Scoring | Medium | Subjective by nature | ⚠️ Partially |
| AUS Scoring | Medium | Based on input analysis | ⚠️ Partially |

#### Conclusion on Bias:

**The comparison is largely fair, but there is inherent subjectivity in SMS and AUS scores.**

To verify fairness, I recommend:
1. **Human Review:** Have a human reader evaluate a sample of v3 vs. v4 stories blind.
2. **A/B Testing:** Present v3 and v4 versions to real users without labels.
3. **Third-Party Evaluation:** Have another AI evaluate the stories independently.
