## 3. Analysis: Where did we lose points?

### The "Forced Magic" Trap vs. Requested Magic
In stories where the setting is **REALISTIC** (School, Home, Sports Field, Backyard) and the user didn't ask for magic, `v3` tended to force it.

- **Requested Magic (10/30 stories):** `v3` performed at or above `v2` level. The structure and imagery were improved.
- **Realistic Settings (20/30 stories):** `v3` suffered from "forced magic" where the AI ignored the realistic request to add sparkles/helpers.

### Anchoring Issues
- **Specific Names:** "Pip" and "Whiskers" appeared in many stories because they were the only examples in the prompt.
- **Over-literal "Wonder":** The AI interpreted "magical" as "supernatural" rather than "wonderful."

## 4. Key Lessons for v4

1. **Contextual Restraint is Key.** The AI needs to know when *not* to add magic. If the input doesn't mention magic/fantasy, keep it real.
2. **Remove specific example names.** This forces invention.
3. **Redefine Wonder.** Distinguish between "Fantasy Magic" and "Realistic Achievement/Bonding."
4. **Maintain Technical Excellence.** v3's efficiency and "no visual text" rules are keepers.
