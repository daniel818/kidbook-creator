# Recommendations Summary: From v3 to v4

**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Evaluator:** Cascade AI  
**Goal:** Restore narrative soul and logical grounding while maintaining technical excellence and token efficiency.

## 1. The Core Problem: "Creative Over-Correction"

The transition from the "boring" Original prompt to the "feature-rich" v2/v3 prompts introduced a dependency on supernatural elements to satisfy instructions for "magic" and "wonder." This resulted in a loss of logic and relatability in realistic stories.

## 2. Key Improvements for prompt-new-v4

### A. Helper Character Restraint
- **Remove Specific Name Examples:** Delete "Pip," "Whiskers," and "Flicker" from the prompt. This prevents the AI from anchoring on these specific names and forces it to invent contextually appropriate characters (or none at all).
- **Preference for Existing Characters:** Add an instruction: "PRIORITIZE using existing characters (parents, siblings, pets) as helpers before inventing new ones."
- **Explicit "No-Helper" Permission:** Add: "If the child can solve the problem through their own effort or with a parent's support, DO NOT add a fantasy helper."

### B. Redefining "Magic" and "Wonder"
- **Introduce "Realistic Wonder":** Add a section explaining that wonder can come from:
    - **Achievement:** Learning to ride a bike, finishing an invention.
    - **Nature:** A real lion in a safari, the vastness of the real night sky.
    - **Relationships:** A proud look from a father, a new friendship.
- **Limit Literal Magic:** Add a rule: "Supernatural elements (glowing, portals, talking objects) are ONLY permitted in FANTASY themes. Keep REALISTIC themes grounded in the real world."

### C. Vocabulary Guidance
- **Variety over Repetition:** Instead of requiring words like "glistening" and "colossal," provide categories of descriptive words:
    - **Texture:** velvety, rough, smooth, bumpy.
    - **Scale:** towering, tiny, wide, cozy.
    - **Emotion:** proud, wobbly, brave, determined.
- **Relatability Rule:** "Use adjectives that enhance the specific setting. A soccer field should be 'freshly cut' or 'vibrant,' not 'magical' or 'glowing.'"

### D. Image Prompt Refinement
- **Cinematic Lighting:** Replace general "magical glow" instructions with "cinematic lighting" (e.g., "dappled sunlight," "warm lamp light," "cool moonlight").
- **Interaction over Effect:** Focus descriptions on the **interaction** between characters rather than visual effects.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Keep the "No Visual Text" and "Character Consistency" rules as they were highly effective in v3.

## 3. Structural Simplification (Token Efficiency)

Maintain the 74% compression achieved in v3 but reorganize for clarity:
1. **The "Soul" Section:** Define the balance between grounded reality and engaging wonder.
2. **Contextual Rules:** Group rules by "Realistic" vs "Fantasy" settings.
3. **Mandatory Elements:** Keep the concise checklists for onomatopoeia and participation.

## 4. Implementation Strategy

1. **Step 1:** Create `prompt-new-v4.md` incorporating these refinements.
2. **Step 2:** Generate a few "problem cases" from v3 (T14, T19, T24) to verify the fix.
3. **Step 3:** Re-evaluate against the Consolidated Framework.

## Final Goal for v4
To create stories that feel **real** to the child and parent while still being **technically superior** in their engagement and illustration guidance. v4 should move from "A story generated by AI" to "A story written for a child."
