## Additional Notes

### Accessibility Considerations

- Logo should be recognizable in grayscale (for colorblind users)
- Icon should be distinguishable without relying solely on color

### Future Considerations
- Logo should support potential sub-brands (e.g., "KidBook Creator Pro")
- Consider animation potential for website loading, app splash screen
- Think about how logo could evolve with seasonal variations (holiday themes)

### Questions for Designer
1. Should the icon be literal (book) or abstract (geometric)?
2. How prominent should magical elements be (sparkles, stars)?
3. Should we incorporate a child figure or keep it more symbolic?
4. Preference for gradient vs flat color in the icon?
5. Should "Creator" be equally prominent or de-emphasized?
