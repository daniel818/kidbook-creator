```

```
Add more magical elements - more sparkles, stars, or light rays. Make it feel more whimsical and wonder-filled while maintaining professional quality.
```

**Simplify for Scalability:**
```
Simplify the logo design. Remove fine details that won't scale well. Make shapes bolder and clearer. Ensure it's recognizable at 32px.
```

**Make More Trustworthy:**
```
Make the logo feel more trustworthy and professional. Reduce overly playful elements, strengthen the structure, use more balanced proportions.
```

**Adjust Color Balance:**
```
Adjust the color balance. [More purple / More orange / More balanced]. Ensure colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements on white backgrounds.
